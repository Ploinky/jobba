# OMP file format

## What is it

Jobba uses a custom binary file format for maps (game worlds). The files have the ending _.omp_.

## Why is it

There is no really good reason to be using custom file formats anywhere in the project. The decision to do so was made for educational and fun-having purposes only.

## How is it

There is no editor for _.omp_ files (yet?). The project contains an export script for [blender](https://www.blender.org/) under _tools_. The blender files must be created in a very specific way for the export to work (of course no documentation for this yet).
